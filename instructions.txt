

## 🛠️ What You Need

✅ Arduino IDE
✅ Processing IDE
✅ The downloaded `.zip` file
✅ Your Arduino with:

* Ultrasonic Sensor (TRIG on A0, ECHO on A1)
* Servo Motor on SER1 (usually pin 11)

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ STEP 1: Install Processing IDE

1. Go to [https://processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download)
2. Download and install the version for your OS (Windows, Mac, Linux)
3. Open the **Processing** app

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Upload Arduino Radar Code

1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Extract the ZIP you downloaded
3. Open `arduino_radar.ino`
4. Connect your Arduino with USB
5. Select the correct **board** and **COM port** from `Tools → Board` and `Tools → Port`
6. Click **Upload (→ arrow button)**

✅ You’re done with Arduino — now close the Serial Monitor if it’s open.

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Run the Radar Display in Processing

1. Open **Processing IDE**
2. Go to `File → Open`, and choose the `radar_display.pde` from the ZIP you downloaded
3. Inside Processing, **look for this line**:

   ```java
   myPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[0], 9600);
   ```
4. Now click **▶️ (Run button)** at the top

### 🧪 If nothing shows, do this:

#### 👉 Show your available serial ports:

Replace the code **temporarily** like this:

```java
void setup() {
  println(Serial.list());
  exit();
}
```

Then run it.

#### ✅ You’ll see:

```text
[0] "COM1"
[1] "COM3"   ← your Arduino might be this
```

Use the correct number in this line:

```java
myPort = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[1], 9600); // Use COM3 or your match
```

Then **remove** the `exit();` and run again.

---

### ✅ Result: You Should See This

* A **radar sweep** in green color
* A rotating line scanning in a circle
* Dots appearing based on object distances

If it doesn’t work, **no worries** — just tell me what’s happening, and I’ll help you fix it instantly.
